# 📊 Shopify Performance Analysis (Power BI)

In this project, I explored e-commerce performance metrics using a Shopify dataset and Power BI. The focus was on tracking KPIs, identifying trends, and using DAX to gain actionable insights into developer performance, product revenue, and user satisfaction across time.

This project sharpened my skills in Power BI visuals, relationships, DAX functions, and real-world storytelling for business intelligence.
